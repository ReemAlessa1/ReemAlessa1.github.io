## Introduction

  There are various views about things to consider while making travel reservations, particularly regarding cost. Individuals typically argue over which season, area or accommodations affect costs the most.
  
It's possible that you've heard remarks like "winter travel is more affordable" or "for a better experience, book in an upscale neighborhood."

When it comes to planning a trip and choosing a destination, we are all different. Examining the data, however, may cause us to rethink our assumptions about what travelers typically like to see and how it affects the market and rental rates.

Therefore, I used data from Seattle Airbnb 2016-2017 open data, to take a closer look at these questions. 

The data provided by Airbnb from 2016–04–04 to 2017–01–02 includes:

•	Listings, including full descriptions and average review score.
•	Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
•	Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
