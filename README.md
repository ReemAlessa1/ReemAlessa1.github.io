# What to Look For When Booking a Space in Seattle

## Introduction

  There are many competing views on what you should look for while booking a space when traveling, specifically when it comes to price. People usually debate which season, area or accommodations has the biggest impact on the price.
You may have heard statements like “it is cheaper to travel during winter” or “you should book in an expensive neighborhood for a better experience.”

We all have our own opinions and preferences when it comes to traveling and booking a destination. But looking into the data might shift our perspective on what people tend to prefer when traveling and how that can have an impact on the market and rent prices.

Therefore, I used data from Seattle Airbnb 2016-2017 open data, to take a closer look at these questions. 
The data provided by Airbnb from 2016–04–04 to 2017–01–02 includes:

•	Listings, including full descriptions and average review score.
•	Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments.
•	Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
